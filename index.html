                  Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly
                  known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
                  general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the
                  first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond
                  pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended
                  to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is
                  widely regarded as the first to recognise the full potential
                  of computers and one of the first computer programmers.

                  Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United

                  programming who invented one of the first linkers. She
                  popularized the idea of machine-independent programming
                  languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early
                  high-level programming language still in use today.

                  Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress, inventor, and
                  film producer. She co-invented an early version of
                  frequency-hopping spread spectrum. At the beginning of World
                  War II, Lamarr and composer George Antheil developed a radio
                  guidance system for Allied torpedoes, intended to use
                  frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology to defeat the
                  threat of jamming by the Axis powers. Although the US Navy did
                  not adopt Lamarr and Antheil's invention until 1957,various
                  spread-spectrum techniques are incorporated into Bluetooth
                  technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions
                  of Wi-Fi.
